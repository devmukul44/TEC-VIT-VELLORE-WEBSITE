		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
		TEC, the Electronics Club organized a demonstration event named PCB Design and Fabrication using Fritzing on 18th October in TT238 at 6pm. The aim of the event was to demonstrate students about hobby PCB designing using free prototyping software called fritzing and showing two methods of PCB manufacture, Toner Transfer and using CNC Router. The event was pioneered by Vibhutesh Kumar Singh with Introduction and then succeeded by Rishabh Shandilya explaining why we need PCBs when we have breadboards and also what is a PCB. Then a 555 timer circuit's PCB layout was designed on the software by Anshul Gupta with assistance from Vibhutesh Kumar Singh. The club members solved all the difficulties of the participating students during the demonstration. After the demonstration, toner transfer method of PCB manufacturing was explained by Manali Shah. Then a short video if a CNC Milling Machine was shown and then the working was explained along with how to export files from the software for CNC milling and drilling. A total of 40 students attended the session. The event was brought to an end with questions and feedback from the participants.

		<h3>Presentation</h3>
		<b>Introduction to PCB and Fritzing: Rishabh Shandilya</b><br>
A Printed circuit board is a mechanical support for electronic components which also integrates electrical connection via traces, pads and vias. A PCB may be single layer, double layer or multi layered. We need PCBs for commercialization of our product, overcoming the problems faced in breadboard prototyping, mainly loose connections, messy wiring, impedance at high frequencies etc.
<br>

<b>Introduction to Fritzing and software demonstration: Anshul Gupta</b><br>
Fritzing is a free, open source prototyping platform and PCB layout software developed for easy design of PCBs for hobbyists, designers, artists etc. It can export high quality image files or portable document files (.pdf) for manual etching and also exports gerber files and excellon drill files for CNC router (Machine manufacturing). The software also consists of auto-router for easy laying out of traces on the board. The demonstrated circuit was a 555 timer circuit. It consisted of all aspects or components of a normal circuit, namely passive components, Integrated Circuits and some special components. Designing was done in all breadboard view and board view. On routing and completion students were demonstrated how to export files necessary for making the board.
<br>
<b>Manual PCB Etching, Toner Transfer Method: Manali Shah</b></br>
After the demonstration, the process of manual PCB etching was shown along with figures. Board designed and etched by club members were circulated among the students along with the design printed out on the film used for etching. A video of this process was also shown along with the final product. Students were also made aware of required files exported from the software.
<br>
<b>CNC Milling of PCBs: Soumil Heble</b><br>
CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine is a way of computer aided manufacture used for manufacturing many kinds of products with great accuracy and finish. Students were shown how to export necessary files form computer aided manufacturing of their PCBs using CNC router. A video demonstration of a CNC router was shown which started from milling the board to drilling and presentation of the finished board. Students were explained about the details during the video. The event was ended with a note of thanks and students were asked for queries.

	<h3>Feedback</h3>
	<p>
First year students who attended the session found the session very informative, amusing and PCB designing very interesting.  They mentioned that, though they had few doubts initially, they were able to cope up well with the help of presenters and volunteers. Second years have specified that the event was very helpful for their PBL courses. Video displayed received quite a few compliments. Few of the participants also said that they are eagerly waiting to join the club. Requests to increase the frequency of events of the club are also seen in these feedback forms .Few suggested that the routing should have been targeted instead of auto routing. Students were very positive regarding distribution of the software .Source of info included posters, announcements, text messages and online publicity in the reverse chronological order .Event was perfectly managed and both presenters and volunteers received a huge applause from participants. Overall feedback was more than satisfactory
