		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
		TEC, the electronics club organized a hand-on session named ELECTRONICS 102 (Digitronix) on 2nd August in TT238 at 6 pm. The main objective of the event was to build on knowledge on the basic concepts of electronics. The target was to introduce the students to digital logic and provide them with a hands-on experience on IR Sensors. The event started by a small introduction by Pulkit Khandelwal describing the agenda of the event. Next, an introduction was given by Rishabh Shandilya on analog vs digital signals along with explanation of different types of number systems. A presentation was given by Ruhi Chandra on Logic Gates and Truth Tables. This was followed by the explanation of Integrated Circuits and an interactive questionnaire round with the participants was done. Lastly, Anshul Gupta explained the circuitry and working of IR Sensors. The practical aspect i.e. the hands-on session was taken care by all the four speakers. A total of 62  students attended the session. They were taught to make an circuit using IR Sensors which was used to blink LED and all the materials were provided to them by TEC and SENSE . The club members actively helped and guided them in case of any problem throughout the session.

		<h3>Presentation</h3>
		<p><b>ANALOG VS DIGITAL SIGNALS + NUMBER SYSTEMS â€“Rishabh Shandilya</b><br>
Here, the difference between the analog and digital signals was explained. Decimal, Binary, Hexadecimal, Octal number systems were explained.
<br> 
<b>LOGIC GATES- Ruhi Chandra</b><br>
AND, OR, NOT, NAND, XOR Gates and their truth tables were explained and different combinations of the same were determined. Positive and Negative logic was explained ( 0V and 5V).
<br>
 
<b>INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND APPLICATIONS- Pulkit Khandelwal</b><br>
Different ICs were explained and how to examine the pins of an IC was taught along with the applications of digital logic were notified example: computer networks, communications.<br>
 
<b>IR SENSORS- Anshul Gupta</b><br>
The composition of an IR Sensor, working , circuitry was taught and each of these were highlighted during the hands-on session.

	<h3>Feedback</h3>
	<p>
	The feedback in totality was very appreciating for the club. Students liked the session and worked very enthusiastically throughout the event. The experience of making their second circuit on a breadboard was very exciting to them. Most of the participants were from ECE branch so they found the idea of hands-on session very helpful in their academic front also. Overall the feedback was positive and the participants demanded for a next event ELECTRONICS 103. </p><br>
