		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
		"Studying in a high profile university has ever inspired you to be the head of such a huge institution???"
Ever dreamt of your own university??<br>
This was the chance we gave participants to redefine the perception of an ideal college as per their accord. Manage their own college, make their own rules, attract students, get accreditations and be the country’s best EDUCATIONAL TYCOON!!
Universities are increasingly facing a double-sided pressure: to be innovative with a specific organizational mission while at the same time being an integrated part of a growing, and highly interconnected, internationalized and standardized higher education ‘industry’. <br>

             Keeping in mind the problems of land resources, capital investment, faculty requirements, Accredition ,Electricity etc… participants were given a simple case study of a struggling university giving all the details of its location ,problems faced, its history etc. The participant team  in the first round was expected to send an abstract making policies in the given models in a manner that is practical and well integrated with each other in such a way that they lead towards the overall development of the independent rather than being independent models of development i.e. only in one of the fields..  and 5 selected teams were promoted to next round where in they were given problem statements and were asked to answer on spot . 
Judgement and prize distribution was done through a proper panel of faculties of VIT.
