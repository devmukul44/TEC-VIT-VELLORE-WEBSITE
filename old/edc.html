		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
		Embedded design contest was a competition conducted by TEC in which the participants had to make a touch screen controlled game using microcontrollers. For this event demo sessions were conducted to guide the participants on how to go about the problem statement and also to solve their queries. The finals of this event was held on 3rd May, 2013 at 6 p.m. in T 503. After a lot of hard work, a total of 10 teams showed up for the finale.

In this contest a touch screen was used as an input device. The input from the device was sent to a microcontroller which in turn showed the output on a graphical LCD. The microcontroller was programmed to run a game which received the inputs from a touch screen.<br>
<b>RESULTS:-</b><br>
The competition was judged by Prof. G Boopalan (SENSE) and Mayank Prasad, (Vice-President, TEC). The gaming devices made by the participants were exceptionally great. The decision was tough to make. After a lot of thinking, the results were declared.
