EVENT DESCRIPTON :-
</h3><br>
<b>Round 1 – “ Who am I ”</b><br>
In this round the participating teams were given a question paper consisting of 15 questions based on identification of basic electronic components on the basis of the clues provided. 10 teams qualified for the second round.<br>
<b>Round 2- “ Coordinated Circuits ” </b><br>
In this round the two teammates were tied with a rope with two of them facing opposite directions and two tables were placed in front of each of them, one table had a circuit diagram and all associated components, while other had a breadboard. According to the setup only one participant can see the circuit and that person has to pick up a component and hand it over to the other participant explaining him/her where and how is that component supposed to be connected on breadboard. This round tested the component identifying and circuit making skills of the participant. The circuits thus made were evaluated  on the basis of number of components correctly evaluated.<br>
<b>RESULTS:-</b><br>
On the basis of the aggregate scores of the two rounds the team which came first was of Shubham Patel and Saurabh Kothari and the runners up team was of Vishwam Aggarwal and Ayush.

The feedback in totality was very appreciating for the club. Participants liked the event and felt that it is one of a kind event and such events should be held more often. They also saw for the first time that electronics and fun are not polar opposites.
