		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
		Ornithopter is an aircraft which flies using flapping of wings as opposed to normal aircrafts which have fixed wings or helicopters which have rotating blades. The ornithopter we are trying to make is a remote controlled mid-sized ornithopter.
The work for the ornithopter project has been divided into two parts- the mechanical part and the electronics part. The mechanical part consists of building the body that consists of the fuselage, the tail and the wings. The fuselage is made with a combination of foam sheets and balsa wood sheets to make the fuselage sturdy and light at the same time. The wings are made using carbon fibre rods and plastics sheets. The tail is also made of the balsa wood and plastics sheets. Till date the prototype of the all the three parts have been made and tested. The tail and the fuselage for the final product is ready and the work on the wings is under progress. The electronics part of ornithopter includes making of a remote controller which controls the servos and the motors connected in the body. The basic layout includes acquiring the analogue data from an analogue joystick, converting it into digital form using ADC converter, transmitting it through the RF (radio-frequency) module using USART (Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) and finally running a servo/DC motor using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) from the values obtained. Till date the ADC conversion, and the controlling of servo using PWM is successfully completed. Currently the task of transmission using RF is in process and after completing this, the controlling of DC motor is to be achieved. We are doing the entire process of ADC, RF transmission and PWM using AVR microcontrollers.
